*We'll Build A Ladder* is a local multiplayer videogame about solidarity and working together.

In the game, players are presented with different characters facing small problems that they need to solve. These problems may be things that you face, or your friends and loved ones face. Some of them are silly, some of them are sad, some of them will seem rather ordinary.

*We'll Build A Ladder* is designed to be played by two people, sitting next to each other. You don't need to know each other, but you will need to communicate with each other. 

No one "wins" this game, unless we win together.
