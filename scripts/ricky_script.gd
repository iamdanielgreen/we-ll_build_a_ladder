#NOTE: MECHANIC IDEA - "HOLDING HANDS", 20/06/2025 - APPROX. 15:00
#When two players are within range of each other, and those ranges overlap, if each player presses and holds 
#a specific button (circle/A/whatever XBOX uses, is it B?), the two players will display new sprites, be able
#to move together (based on whomever provides input first, perhaps?) and be shown HOLDING HANDS.

#Moving together will require active communication between the players, as there shouldn't be a visual indicator 
#for whose inputs the characters are following. This should on some occasions be difficult, because communication
#with others can be difficult. But this should also be necessary for overall success.
# -> An early tutorial level could be "WE GET ALONG", which simply requires two players to hold hands, as a
# demonstration of the mechanic.

#Use of the mechanic should not be mandatory for ALL levels, but should ALWAYS benefit the players (or at least
#provide some sort of alternative outcome if players make this work.
