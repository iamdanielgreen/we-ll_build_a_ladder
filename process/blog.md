## Original level title ideas and early thoughts. - 10/05/2025

[Written on a phone on the way to, during and maybe even after a Grace Petrie gig.]

We Build A Ladder
We Fix A Fence
We Carry A Drink
We Have A Picnic
We Make A Fire
We Climb A Mountain - must pick up other player otherwise it doesn't count
We Surf A Crowd
We Raise A Glass
We Climb A Tree
We Launch A Rocket
We Dance A Tango
We Make A Sandwich

Keywords denote type of action, and how the player completes the challenge?
- maybe not exactly this, but some kind of warioware like hint?

## More notes after a temporary freakout about changing the whole project to being a 3D game. - Let's say this was 19/06/2025

We Move A Piano
We take a walk - protest, but slowly 

A BUTTON FOR HOLDING HANDS

## 22/06/2025

We share silence - players do nothing
We look after each other - one player must hold the other player's hand to cheer them up
We dance together - rhythm game, synchronised?

- THE ACTION BUTTON ALWAYS DOES SOMETHING THAT HELPS THE PLAYER

We Climb A Tree - climb parts of a tree to collect fruit?
- - we pick blackberries

## For the To-Do List - 21/07/2025

TODO
- add prompt after 3 seconds saying to press down action button
-- which needs to be a Kenney icon, or one of your own design
--- with extra frames, just like penny and wario taught you

- Add button that allows player to move to next level

ALL THE LITTLE GUYS SHOULD BE IN THE PROTEST MARCH.
ALL THE LITTLE GUYS ARE TAKING CARE OF EACH OTHER.
ALL THE LITTLE GUYS NEED TO BE IN THE COVER ART.

## I don't have time to write this now (Quick thoughts on the timer) - 06/08/2025, 14:00 + 18:16

You've been having *thoughts* about the timer. Mostly, why? Why the timer? How long is the timer? And finally, and simply, *Does the timer need to be there at all?* In the playtest that happened the other week on campus, the majority present agreed that it did - based around a vague idea that this is part of the Warioware/microgame schtick. Add an option to extend or remove the timer for those who want a more chill time, was the thought in the room.

Mostly, I agree with this. It gives the game a sense of pace - a sense of *urgency* - and fits with my broader thinking about the game and it's themes. The time for action is *now*, not *whenever you solve the puzzle*.

This is all well and good, but who exactly does this impulse serve? And therein lies the dilemma. I increasingly believe it doesn't serve anyone, other than a feeling/allegiance to a particular sort of videogame convention.

In talking about the level "We'll Share Silence", my partner and I have been in an ongoing discussion over whether or not ten seconds is a enough time to figure this out. Especially given that you need to spend five seconds out of ten not doing *anything* in the level in order to solve it (I can of course change the specific numbers, but that's not the main issue here). With my Warioware hat on, I keep saying that ten seconds is longer than you might think. And this might be true, if (as she correctly points out) I only I could do something so wild as *make a playable build for people to try this out*.

On a train this morning, I brought this topic up again. Because, increasingly, the words "*maybe the timer has to go*" have been circling around my brain. In talking about this, I outlined the points above. I talked about what the game wants to *be*, and who it might be *for*, and whether the time pressure really serves the greater point here. I genuinely don't know the answer to this. Which all told means I probably should test both scenarios and see which feels better. 

But for now, I'm going to quickly work on the prototype level I was supposed to be working on before I started writing this.
