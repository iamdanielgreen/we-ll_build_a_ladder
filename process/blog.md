# I don't have time to write this now (Quick thoughts on the timer) - 06/08/2025, 14:00 + 18:16

You've been having *thoughts* about the timer. Mostly, why? Why the timer? How long is the timer? And finally, and simply, *Does the timer need to be there at all?* In the playtest that happened the other week on campus, the majority present agreed that it did - based around a vague idea that this is part of the Warioware/microgame schtick. Add an option to extend or remove the timer for those who want a more chill time, was the thought in the room.

Mostly, I agree with this. It gives the game a sense of pace - a sense of *urgency* - and fits with my broader thinking about the game and it's themes. The time for action is *now*, not *whenever you solve the puzzle*.

This is all well and good, but who exactly does this impulse serve? And therein lies the dilemma. I increasingly believe it doesn't serve anyone, other than a feeling/allegiance to a particular sort of videogame convention.

In talking about the level "We'll Share Silence", my partner and I have been in an ongoing discussion over whether or not ten seconds is a enough time to figure this out. Especially given that you need to spend five seconds out of ten not doing *anything* in the level in order to solve it (I can of course change the specific numbers, but that's not the main issue here). With my Warioware hat on, I keep saying that ten seconds is longer than you might think. And this might be true, if (as she correctly points out) I only I could do something so wild as *make a playable build for people to try this out*.

On a train this morning, I brought this topic up again. Because, increasingly, the words "*maybe the timer has to go*" have been circling around my brain. In talking about this, I outlined the points above. I talked about what the game wants to *be*, and who it might be *for*, and whether the time pressure really serves the greater point here. I genuinely don't know the answer to this. Which all told means I probably should test both scenarios and see which feels better. 

But for now, I'm going to quickly work on the prototype level I was supposed to be working on before I started writing this.
