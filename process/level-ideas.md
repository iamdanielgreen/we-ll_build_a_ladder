Updated all level titles/candidates and repository name to "We'll..." rather than "We" to better reflect the source material that the game is inspired by.

## Tutorial Levels

#### We'll Jump For Joy
#### (They do nothing) We'll Take Action [added 30/07/25, 17:56]
#### (They make noise) We'll Share Silence

*DESIGN NOTE: Do the tutorial levels show the prompt sentence (e.g., "They build a wall, We Build A Ladder")? Let's try it and see if it's weird.*

The two players appear on screen. They are in a white void. All they have to so is remain still. If they do this for three seconds, they complete the puzzle.


## Game Levels

#### (You Build A Wall) We'll Build A Ladder
##### 30/07/2025, 17:40

The two players stand in front of a wall. A pile of wood sits in front of the wall. The players approach the wall, and as they each press the action button, a ladder starts to emerge from the pile. Once the ladder is taller than the wall itself, the players win.

#### We'll Fix A Fence
#### We'll Carry A Drink
#### We'll Have A Picnic
#### We'll Make A Fire
#### We'll Climb A Mountain
#### We'll Surf A Crowd
#### We'll Raise A Glass
#### We'll Climb A Tree
##### 30/07/2025, 17:45

The two players appear as a lemon and a lime. A tree appears on screen, with branches acting as steps that allow them to climb the tree. Once they reach the top of the tree, the arms and legs of the lemon and lime disappear, leaving only the two fruits hanging out in the tree, with smiles on their faces. If both players are in the tree when the timer runs out, they win.
-- Or perhaps a small timer starts when they reach the top of the tree. Once it counts down three seconds, the players win?

#### We'll Launch A Rocket
#### We'll Dance A Tango
#### We'll Make A Sandwich
#### We'll Share Silence (tutorial level?)
#### We'll Look After Each Other / We Take Care of Each Other (tutorial level?)
#### We'll Dance Together
#### We'll Climb A Tree / We Pick Blackberries
#### We'll Wait For A Train
#### We'll Make A Sculpture

##### (Notes from 20/07/2025)
- Two parts of a "classical" sculpture (head and torso)
- One player rolls heads along platform, other player moves torso.
- - Win condition involves head landing on top of torso, roughly in position of neck (Head smiles?)
- - If Head lands on shoulders, this doesn't count (Head shows sad face.)

#### We'll Take A Walk

You think of this as the last level of the game, or at least that other levels may lead to this level. The two players find themselves on either side of of a large crowd. To win, the players slot themselves into two gaps in the crowd, joining a protest march.

#### We'll Keep It Cool -> We'll Get A Drink

**(Notes from 20/07/2025)**
You have previously drawn some little guys resembling a cup and an ice cube, which could absolutely form the basis of a version of this level.
- "We keep it cool?"
- - -> Add the bottle of drink
- - - "We get a drink"
