# Level Ideas
**(31/07/2025, 08:48)** Updated all level titles/candidates and repository name to "We'll..." rather than "We" to better reflect [the source material that the game is inspired by](https://gracepetrie.bandcamp.com/track/you-build-a-wall).

## Tutorial Levels

#### We'll Jump For Joy

**(17/07/2025, based on notebook notes)** The two players are on a platform. When they both press the jump button, the level is solved. They do not have to do this at the same time.
- A tutorial level, one of three (?) that demonstrates each of the action buttons. It is intentionally as basic as it looks.
- After five seconds, a tutorial prompt appears on screen instructing players to press the Down Action Button

**(20/07/2025, whilst on a plane)** Prototype created. Currently works, and has been inserted into main sequence. It's currently the only level inserted into the main sequence.

#### (They do nothing) We'll Take Action [added 30/07/25, 17:56]
#### We'll ~~Look After~~ Take Care of Each Other / We Take Care of Each Other

**(31/07/2025, 12:12)** One player is sad. The other player can make them feel better by offering to hold their hand. If the other player accepts this, they win the level.
- It's worth thinking about that so far this the only example of a level where the solution is based around holding hands. Does this create problems for future you?

#### (They make noise) We'll Share Silence
##### (30/07/2025, 17:53 (Edited 03/08/25, 13:29)) 
*DESIGN NOTE: Do the tutorial levels show the prompt sentence (e.g., "They build a wall, We Build A Ladder")? Let's try it and see if it's weird.*

The two players appear on screen. They are in a white void. All they have to so is remain still. If they do this for three seconds, they ~~complete the puzzle~~ solve the level.

**(31/07/2025, 11:49)** Everything the player does creates sound - jumping, walking, pressing the action button. Even holding hands emits an "Awww" in the background. The point is to simply remain still (or perhaps, if holding hands, the timer only ticks down after the "Awww" sound stops playing).

**(05/08/2025, 17:59)** As of last night, this level has been prototyped, though currently works independent of the main project (ie, level has not been attached to main sequence). There is currently a bug that *can* occur when the level resolves (current theory is that this has something to do with receiving inputs *after* the level is technically stopped), but I can't reliably recreate it using this method.


## Game Levels

#### (You Build A Wall) We'll Build A Ladder
##### 30/07/2025, 17:40

The two players stand in front of a wall. A pile of wood sits in front of the wall. The players approach the wall, and as they each press the action button, a ladder starts to emerge from the pile. Once the ladder is taller than the wall itself, the players win.

#### We'll Fix A Fence
#### We'll Carry A Drink
#### We'll Have A Picnic
#### We'll Make A Fire
#### We'll Climb A Mountain
#### We'll Surf A Crowd
#### We'll Raise A Glass
#### We'll Climb A Tree

**(30/07/2025, 17:45)** The two players appear as a lemon and a lime. A tree appears on screen, with branches acting as steps that allow them to climb the tree. Once they reach the top of the tree, the arms and legs of the lemon and lime disappear, leaving only the two fruits hanging out in the tree, with smiles on their faces. If both players are in the tree when the timer runs out, they win.
-- Or perhaps a small timer starts when they reach the top of the tree. Once it counts down three seconds, the players win?

#### We'll Launch A Rocket
#### We'll Dance A Tango
#### We'll Make A Sandwich
~~#### We'll Share Silence~~

Moved to Tutorial Levels.

~~#### We'll Look After Each Other / We Take Care of Each Other~~

Moved to Tutorial Levels.

#### We'll Dance Together
#### We'll Climb A Tree / We Pick Blackberries
#### We'll Wait For A Train
#### We'll Make A Sculpture

##### (Notes from 20/07/2025)
- Two parts of a "classical" sculpture (head and torso)
- One player rolls heads along platform, other player moves torso.
    - Win condition involves head landing on top of torso, roughly in position of neck (Head smiles?)
    - If Head lands on shoulders, this doesn't count (Head shows sad face.)

#### We'll Take A Walk
##### 28/07/2025, 21:59

You think of this as the last level of the game, or at least that other levels may lead to this level. The two players find themselves on either side of of a large crowd. To win, the players slot themselves into two gaps in the crowd, joining a protest march.

#### We'll Keep It Cool -> We'll Get A Drink

**(Notes from 20/07/2025)**

You have previously drawn some little guys resembling a cup and an ice cube, which could absolutely form the basis of a version of this level.
- "We keep it cool?"
    - -> Add the bottle of drink
        - "We get a drink"

#### "We'll Grow Togehter"

**(31/07/2025, 12:XX)**

One player is a pot plant, the other is the sun. The two must line up, at which point the sun will shine light on the plant. At this point, the players win/the level is solved.
- Holding Hands: With both players pressing the Hands input, the plant will grow taller as the light shines on them.

#### "We'll Take The Win"

**(05/08/2025, 08:43)** The two players stand on a dias/medal podium (what's the actual word for this?). One is in second place, the other in third. To solve the level, both players have to stand on the first place position. 
- DESIGN NOTE: One of the players is a weightlifter, who is perpetually holding a set of barbells.

**(18:07)** You've thought this a lot over the course of the day, but this is essentially a retooling of "prototype01"
